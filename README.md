### Introduction:-

This is a simple point-of-sale (POS) system built using Java and MySQL that allows users to manage inventory, create bills, and print receipts. 
The application uses Java Swing to provide a graphical user interface, and MySQL as the database management system.

- Billing: Users can select products from the inventory and add them to the billing list. The application calculates the total cost and generates a bill.
- Bill printing: Users can print the bill and provide it to the customer.

### Requirements:-

- MySQL Connector
- Apache Netbeans

### Technologies Used:-

- Java 8 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
